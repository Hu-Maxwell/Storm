1. fix bug that disables "isJumping" when touching wall
2. add wall jump
3. add buffer for jump (also check if StartCoroutine(doubleJump()) has a simpler solution)
4. add a little check so that if the bird is too close to the floor, it will not double jump and instead buffer a normal jump
5. add coyote time
6. add movement animations
7. add movement effects
8. order the vars in the unity UI if possible
