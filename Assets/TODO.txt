- COMPLETE 1. fix bug that disables "isJumping" when touching wall 
- COMPLETE 2. add wall jump

X. make it so that touching wall isn't related to the sprite
- draw ray to left / right,
- can wall jump if bottom 3/4th of bird is touching the wall, if only top 1/4th, cannot

X. add movement animations
X. add movement effects

X. add buffer for jump (also check if StartCoroutine(doubleJump()) has a simpler solution)
- if jump is pressed, and double jump is done already, and if not touching wall,
  - bufferJump = true
  - wait .25 secs
  - bufferJump = false
- elsewhere in the code: 
  - if bufferJump == true and floor is touched, then jump

X. add a little check so that if the bird is too close to the floor, it will not double jump and instead buffer a normal jump
- if double jump is free, and if bird is too X distance from floor, 
  - bufferFirstJump = true for .25 seconds; (in case if character dashes) 

X. add coyote time
- if time since last touched ground < .25 and if jump is pressed
  - call first jump 

X. edit jump gravity in different parts of the jump
- 0 to 3/4ths to max height: normal grav
- 3/4ths to max and then max to 3/4ths: low grav
- 3/4ths to 0: high grav

X. order the vars in the unity UI if possible
